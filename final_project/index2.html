		<p>Hi! My name's Napoleon (Polo for short). I live in Cambridge, MA on Gold Star Road, near where the bike path crosses Mass Ave. I am an indoor / outdoor cat who LOVES adventures!</p>
		
		<p>If you find me and I'm not far from home and uninjured, I am probably fine! My human only asks that you please don't feed me and please don't keep me inside. But please DO <a href="http://napoleonsightings.tumblr.com/submit">share any cute photos or fun stories</a> with my human (she likes to know what I get up to!)</p>
		
		<p>If I am far from  home, injured, or in distress, please call the phone number on my collar or contact <a href="mailto:napoleonsightings@gmail.com?subject=Hi%20lovely%20person&body=I%20saw%20Napoleon!">napoleonsightings@gmail.com</a>.</p>
		
		<p>Thank you friends!</p>

						<h3>Is Napoleon hurt, scared, causing problems, or really far from home?</h3>

						<p>Call me right away, using the phone number on his tag. If he's more than half a mile from home, or you've seen him in the same area several times over 24 hours, he might be lost. Give me a call. (Or if he took off his collar, shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:napoleonsightings@gmail.com">napoleonsightings@gmail.com</a>).</p>

						<h3>Is Napoleon close to home and having a ball?</h3>

						<p><a href="http://napoleonsightings.tumblr.com/submit" target="_blank">Tell me where you saw him!</a> I'm always curious as to what my adventurous little cat is up to. I'd also like to figure out his range, so if you can include information about where exactly you saw him, I'd appreciate it.</p>

		<p>Here's some things I love:</p>

		<ul>

			<li>Meeting new people</li>
			<li>Head rubs</li>
			<li>Scratches under my chin</li>
			<li>Exploring new places &ndash; like your house!</li>
			<li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Eating food!</span> Wait. Please don't feed me &ndash; my human is in charge of my food so I go home every night for dinner.)</li>
			<li>SINGING! You may call it yowling. But it is <em>music</em>.</li>

		</ul>

	<p>I love meeting new people &ndash; friends are the best! I believe that the best way to make friends is to come up and rub your face on someone's ankle and meow (for cats) or scratch someone behind the ears or under the chin (for humans).</p>

	<p>I also love snacks! ...But please don't feed them to me. Despite my roaming ways, I have a lovely human that I go home to every night for food. She appreciates that you only give me love and head rubs, so she can make sure I come home and get any medication I might need (and so she can keep track of me!)</p>

	<p>I love doing puzzles! I can't decide if my favorite part is batting the little pieces to the floor, or using my teeth to pull apart pieces my human's already put together.</p>
