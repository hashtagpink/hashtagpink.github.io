		<p>Hi! My name's Napoleon (Polo for short). I live in Cambridge, MA on Gold Star Road, near where the bike path crosses Mass Ave. I am an indoor / outdoor cat who LOVES adventures!</p>
		
		<p>If you find me and I'm not far from home and uninjured, I am probably fine! My human only asks that you please don't feed me and please don't keep me inside. But please DO <a href="http://napoleonsightings.tumblr.com/submit">share any cute photos or fun stories</a> with my human (she likes to know what I get up to!)</p>
		
		<p>If I am far from  home, injured, or in distress, please call the phone number on my collar or contact <a href="mailto:napoleonsightings@gmail.com?subject=Hi%20lovely%20person&body=I%20saw%20Napoleon!">napoleonsightings@gmail.com</a>.</p>
		
		<p>Thank you friends!</p>

		<p>Here's some things I love:</p>

		<ul>

			<li>Meeting new people</li>
			<li>Head rubs</li>
			<li>Scratches under my chin</li>
			<li>Exploring new places &ndash; like your house!</li>
			<li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Eating food!</span> Wait. Please don't feed me &ndash; my human is in charge of my food so I go home every night for dinner.)</li>
			<li>SINGING! You may call it yowling. But it is <em>music</em>.</li>

		</ul>

	<p>I love doing puzzles! I can't decide if my favorite part is batting the little pieces to the floor, or using my teeth to pull apart pieces my human's already put together.</p>

		<p>I love meeting new people &ndash; friends are the best! I believe that the best way to make friends is to come up and rub your face on someone's ankle and meow (for cats) or scratch someone behind the ears or under the chin (for humans).</p>

	<p>I also love snacks! ...But please don't feed them to me. Despite my roaming ways, I have a lovely human that I go home to every night for food. She appreciates that you only give me love and head rubs, so she can make sure I come home and get any medication I might need (and so she can keep track of me!)</p>

	<p>The puppy and I are checking out this strange new addition to our house. The human says it's for us to sharpen our claws on but I don't know about that...</p.>
